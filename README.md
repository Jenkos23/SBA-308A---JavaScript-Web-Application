# SBA-308A---JavaScript-Web-Application




Note: I initially attempted to retrieve data from an anime API using Axios, but it didn't yield the desired results. As a result, I switched to using a cat API with the Fetch method. This is why the folder is named NanimeApp. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to rename it. However, you may come across comments referring to anime, as I was originally working on that before transitioning to the cat API.


My folder contains six files. The json package that was installed. The "module" folder includes `cat.js` and `index.js`, which handle my import and export calls. The app is designed to display a unique breed of cat along with its name and description. In the navbar, you'll find the app's logo and a dropdown menu for selecting a cat breed, along with a "Get Cat Breed" button. When you select a breed and click the button, the carousel will show the corresponding cat's image, name, and description.

Additionally, the form input is used to post data to the cat API. The `index.html` and `style.css` files contain the app's HTML structure and styling, respectively. I'm still working on getting the POST method to function properly, but I'm confident I'll sort it out. Thank you!
