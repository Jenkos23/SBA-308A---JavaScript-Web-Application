# SBA-308A---JavaScript-Web-Application




Note: I initially attempted to retrieve data from an anime API using Axios, but it didn't yield the desired results. As a result, I switched to using a cat API with the Fetch method. This is why the folder is named NanimeApp. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to rename it. However, you may come across comments referring to anime, as I was originally working on that before transitioning to the cat API.
